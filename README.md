## COVID19 Analysis of Johns Hopkins Data set

## Description of the Data Resource

The Johns Hopkins Corona-virus Resource Center established a new standard for infectious disease tracking by publicly providing pandemic data in near real time. It began Jan. 22, 2020 as the COVID-19 Dashboard, operated by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering and the Applied Physics Laboratory. This is the data set that will be used for this analysis. The Corona-virus Resource Center has ceased it data collection as of March 2022. Further information can be found at <https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/>

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to explore the COVID-19 data set from Johns Hopkins University. The data set contains information on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for countries around the world. The analysis will focus on visualizing the data, identifying trends, and gaining insights into the spread of the virus.

## Data Collection

The data set used in this analysis is sourced from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) COVID-19 Data Repository.
